This folder contains static files that are meant to be hosted by the same server hosting the web application, such as favicon.ico, robots.txt and crossdomain.xml.

Also, static assets for the Django admin should be stored here, as they do not need be served from a different server.

Files in this folder will never be hosted on a different server (such as S3 or a CDN), as opposed to files stored in the "static/" folder.
